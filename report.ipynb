    "# Introduction\n",
    "This report addresses the problem of survival prediction using the Titanic dataset. The dataset includes information about passengers such as age, gender, ticket class, and whether they survived. The objective is to predict survival outcomes using machine learning algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dataset Description\n",
    "The Titanic dataset contains features like:\n",
    "- **PassengerId**: Unique identifier for passengers\n",
    "- **Survived**: Target variable (1 = survived, 0 = did not survive)\n",
    "- **Pclass**: Passenger class (1, 2, 3)\n",
    "- **Name, Sex, Age, etc.**: Demographic and other information\n"
